# Scripts to run on an Oracle Enterprise Manager 12 repository

Welcome to my repository of Oracle Enterprise Manager 12 scripts. I used these to keep track of incidents, users, roles and privileges. More here:

Unfortunately I won't update these scripts anymore. After 20 years I left the world of Oracle and became a Hadoop specialist in March 2017. Read more about my new adventures here: http://marcel-jan.eu/datablog

## A quick explanation:

### em12_incidents_report.sql
A large amount of scripts to dissect all incidents in EM12.

### em12_security_report.sql
A couple of scripts to show users, roles and privileges in EM12.

### em12_session_report.sql
But wait, whoâ€™s logged on?

### em12_targets_report.sql
What targets has EM12 discovered? In case of Fusion Middleware, expect thousands of them.
